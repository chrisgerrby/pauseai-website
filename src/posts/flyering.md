## Welcome to the PauseAI Flyering Guide! 
Flyering is a simple yet powerful way to reach new people, spark conversations, and invite them to get involved. Use this guide to plan, execute, and follow up on your flyering sessions in a way that feels comfortable, effective, and fun.

## You can do this! 
“I’m not the activist type. I’m an introvert with high social anxiety (and I might be a little autistic). Thinking about engaging people on the street made me so nervous I felt physically ill. There are few things I was more afraid of than embarrassing myself in public, but the literal end of the world is one of those things. So, I put that fear to my back, and I let it push me forward. I did it anyway — I did it scared. I ordered all the supplies, planned a day and a place, and went alone. It took about an hour for me to feel like I knew what I was doing. After I had some positive and negative interactions, I noticed I was still alive, I stopped feeling scared, and against all expectations, I started having fun.” 

— Nathan Metzger

## Why flyering?

- **Build your local community:** Flyering is a first step toward creating and growing a [local PauseAI community](/local-organizing). It helps you reach curious people who can join and strengthen your group.  
- **Announce a gathering:** Your flyers should ideally point to a concrete action, like a local meeting or event soon after the flyering day. This gives interested individuals a clear next step and makes the most of their attention.  
- **Create human-to-human connections:** In-person conversations increase trust and credibility that digital outreach alone can’t match. By engaging face-to-face, you’re humanizing the cause, making it more relatable, and encouraging deeper, more meaningful involvement.

## Before the event: preparations 
- Print at least 100 flyers for every volunteer attending. 
- Include a date/time/place for a follow-up event (ideally the weekend after you flyer), if applicable. 
- Have QR codes ready for online resources, your local Facebook group, or a messaging app where you can communicate in the future. 
- Create a Luma event for your upcoming flyering day and invite your friends.
- Check the the laws in your jurisdiction before heading out. Usually you don't need to worry about attention from security or police. Be aware that your specific location may have additional rules and restrictions; if any special permissions are required, seek approval well in advance.

### Flyer contents
- Use existing materials in the [Flyers folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1MAU_bq31bEuylhzkt2NkZ_XRY6TlKaqZ?usp=drive_link), or customize via the [Figma template](https://www.figma.com/design/iQ4PHQTi1vAVmT9Lckazqt/PauseAI-designs---editable).  
- Clearly state the event time and location if applicable.
- Strong calls to action: “Learn what YOU can do”, “YOU can help”, “Get involved”.  We want to select for the agentic people. 
- Include a QR code linking to relevant resources or your local group’s signup.

### Flyer printing
There are many, many options for printing flyers, depending on budget constraints and quality requirements. Double-sided full-color printing can be pricey (on the order of $1 per page).

- Consider full-color double-sided prints if possible.
- For same-day, cheap printing, you can usually find a printer at your local university, library or municipal house. 
- For cost-effective options, try [48 Hour Print](https://www.48hourprint.com/) or [Bizay](https://us.bizay.com/).  
- Print a few days in advance—don’t wait until the last minute! 

### Flyering session setup
- An A-frame sign can help attract interest. It gives those who read it a chance to choose to engage you on their own. It can make people think, even if they haven’t directly engaged. See [PauseAI Flyering Sign (3x4).pdf](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1DNjgsD-QTL6Xf_MI_0COiYOCO3rVhNZ2/view?usp=drive_link)
- A clipboard, pen and sign-up form make it easier to capture contact info. When people fill out their email, it's much easier to contact them, invite them to events, and organize a local group. 
- Multiple volunteers joining in? Consider splitting up or setting up a small [table](https://pauseai.info/tabling).
- Present flyers neatly, and wear a PauseAI [merchandise](https://pauseai-shop.fourthwall.com/) that identifies you as part of the community. 
- If possible, use a standout poster, vertical banner nearby, so people see a visual cue before reaching you. This prepares them for what you’re offering and can increase acceptance rates.
- Plan to stay out for a least a few hours. Think about how much time you spent preparing for the flyering session compared to how much time you spent there.
- Once you arrive at your destination of flyering, walk around and see if there are any higher traffic areas nearby.
- **Above all**, prioritize your safety throughout the session.

## Choosing a location & timing 
- Identify high-traffic spots (university quads, conference entrances, tradeshow floors) that fit your cause. Try a short test run to see where engagement is strongest.  
- Align your flyering with peak foot traffic (e.g., pre-lunch rush, post-lecture crowds). Short, high-density distribution sessions can boost efficiency.  
- Position yourself near areas where people are more likely to care (like professional networking lounges or event booths).  
- University campuses are ideal due to openness and foot traffic.
  - They have areas that are open to the public, where solicitation is allowed so long as the local laws and the campus’s rules of etiquette are followed.
  - People at universities are usually have more curious and energetic, and they usually have time on their hands.
  - They can be predictably busy at specific times of day in specific locations. Trying to target a specific subset of students isn’t necessary at all, since all kinds of people share these concerns. 
- Parks and Public Spaces are usually good locations as people aren't busy to get anywhere. Check regulations and ensure there’s enough foot traffic.

## During the flyering session

*(These tips are detailed to help even if you’re new to this. The most important thing is to get out there and try! You’ll learn fast once you start!)*

0. **Spot the right people:**  
   Offer flyers to those who seem available—walking at a relaxed pace, not glued to their phones, not rushing to their next meeting. If someone looks too busy or is clearly avoiding you, don’t waste time or energy. Focus on the next opportunity.

1. **Make eye contact, smile, wave and hold out a flyer:**
    Everyone likes to see a friendly face. By waving, you get people's attention. It's a powerful combination. Then use one the go-to lines "Can I get you a flyer?" when they are close enough to hear you (find more below). Adjust your tone and body language if the person seems particularly gentle or shy—speak a bit softer, appear a little less imposing. Remember, your goal is to engage them. If there are no people nearby, smile and wave to people at a distance! 
   
2. **Balance conversations and volume:**  
   Not everyone will stop to chat—and that’s what you should expect. Some people will just take a flyer and move on. But when someone does want to dive deeper and would like to talk for a while, do so! Focus on people who already have concerns or are curious about AI. You might find power allies this way. Don’t focus on skeptics—politely wrap it up and focus on sharing flyers with others who might be more receptive.

3. **Seek out their perspective, validate, and update:**  
   People are worried about AI’s effect on jobs, privacy, or misinformation—maybe not existential risk. That’s fine. Validate their perspective, then show how PauseAI’s mission includes their concerns. By saying, “Yes, I care about that too, here's another thing you might find concerning”, you broaden their understanding without while still validating their feelings and perspective.

4. **Have a few go-to lines ready:**  
  Opening with “Can I get you a flyer?” often works better than “Can I give you a flyer?” because it feels like you’re providing value rather than asking a favor. To get attention:  
     
     - “Can I get you a flyer?” 
     - “Want to learn more about AI risks?”

     When they ask what it’s about:  
     - “We’re bridging the gap between what AI experts know and what most people hear.”  
     - “We’re concerned about building AI systems we can’t fully control yet.”  
     - “We advocate for a global pause on the biggest AI training runs.”  
     - “We’re a grassroots movement focused on reducing AI risks, sharing what experts worry about.”

   Start from common ground. Don’t open with extinction as it can be off-putting. Let the conversation unfold naturally and be ready to provide more details if they’re interested.

### How people respond 
- Most people who would happily accept a flyer won’t ask for one. 
- A small subset of people do engage directly and ask for a flyer or start a conversation. 
- In a space with a lot of people, the law of large numbers works for you. 
- Some people might say they agree with you, but still not want a flyer (and that is okay). 
- People are in general very polite. 
- The vast majority of interactions are positive rather than negative. 
- Of the people who stop to talk to you, many of them are likely to automatically treat you as if you know what you’re talking about, you have authority. 

## Once you are done with flyering for the day, go and have some fun!
