## **Guide to Writing Effective Press Releases**

#### *Learn how to write professional press releases that grab attention, communicate your message, and increase the likelihood of coverage.*

Press releases are essential tools for communicating key news and events to the public. Unlike social media posts, press releases provide a relatable and reliable format that journalists know. Press releases should complement a broader media strategy to gain attention effectively.


## What is a Press Release?

*A press release is a brief written update to inform the media about your group’s news, your perspective on important events in the world, or activities while also providing a summary of past events when relevant.* 

## Key Considerations to Keep in Mind 

- Journalists need quotes, stories, angles, and narratives that they can use to get views on their articles. Imagine that the quotes they get from your article are ammunition they can use.
- Their goal is to expand their market share and earn more money.
- Journalists do not want to get educated, and they don't need to be persuaded.
- Journalists who follow AI know that they ALL will soon lose their jobs if scaling continues. We share their goal of halting development. They are our allies.
- Journalists only speak in one language—their own. When you reach out to them, you have to speak that language too. Your press release must mimic the format and style of a news story. Journalists don't use caveats after every statement they make, neither should you. Journalists use hyperbole, so can we.
- Journalists focus on recent events rather than ongoing issues.
- News fades into old news in a matter of days. If you intend to send your take about an event, do so before it becomes old news.
- They want to be sent information they don't have access to.
- You need to give journalists enough notice about your action or event, but not so much that they forget about it. Strive to send out an advance release to them 10 days before, then again 2 days before your event. Journalists have a three-second attention span and a 30-second memory, so you need to keep to the case.
- It takes time to write an article.
- There is only so much space in an article; there are only so many articles to read. Try to distance your event from other big events that will fill the articles and people's attention span.
- A sight of a huge block of text will put the journalist off. Remember, they have a 3-second attention span and they are very busy.
- Use metaphors and anecdotes people can relate to; don't use generalizations or abstractions. Don't use jargon, abbreviations, or technical terminology.
- Journalists get sent lots of press releases every day. The worst, and most likely case, is that they will click "archive" on your email and forget.

## Elements of the Press Release, in Order

#### 1. Contact Details

Ensure the top of the page prominently displays:

- Your organization’s name in bold.
- One or more contact names.
- Reliable phone numbers, including mobile numbers, for immediate availability.

#### 2. Embargo Information (if needed)

Specify a publication time for advance stories, such as:

- "EMBARGO: 00.01am, Friday 15th May."
- Use embargoes for events or actions to ensure timely coverage but avoid them for breaking news.

#### 3. Headline

Keep it short (under eight words), clear, and engaging. Avoid overly clever puns and focus on grabbing attention. Practice writing headlines by observing newspaper styles.

#### 4. First Paragraph

Summarize the story in one concise sentence, ensuring all essential details are clear. This “lead” determines if journalists will read further.

#### 5. Body Text

Limit to two or three paragraphs of simple, jargon-free sentences. Expand on the five Ws (Who, What, Where, When, Why) and How. Remember that journalists focus on recent events and need timely, relevant information. News fades quickly, so ensure your release arrives before it becomes old news.

#### 6. Notes for Journalists

Optionally, include detailed background information on a separate page. Keep this section under a page and use numbered paragraphs for clarity. Avoid large blocks of text, as they may deter busy journalists with short attention spans.

#### 7. Closing Contact Details

Reiterate contact information at the end to ensure accessibility for follow-up.


### Format and Technical Guidelines

1. **Dateline:** Include the location and date (e.g., "Washington, D.C., Oct 15").
2. **Spacing:** Use short paragraphs with spaces in between.
3. **Length:** Keep releases to 2–3 pages, using subheads for readability.
4. **Attachments:** Add summaries or detailed quotes as needed. Quotes should provide compelling narratives or angles journalists can use to attract readers.
5. **Numbers and Statistics:** Spell out numbers under ten; use numerals for ten and above.
6. **Attributions:** Place speaker’s name at the end of quotes. Quotes should sound natural and relatable.
7. Include links to relevant supporting documents, reports, or resources to give journalists more context and background for their stories.
8. Provide high-resolution images or media assets as attachments or via a download link to enhance the appeal of your story.
9. Tailor your press release to fit the interests or beats of the specific journalist or outlet to increase relevance. 

## Mailing Lists

- Build an extensive and targeted list of media contacts. Consider using tools like customer relationship management (CRM) software to organize and maintain your list efficiently. CRM platforms can help track interactions with reporters, schedule follow-ups, and ensure your contact database remains up-to-date.
- Identify reporters who cover related topics and build personal connections.
- Regularly review and update your media list to remove outdated contacts.
- Use social media platforms to identify and engage with journalists interested in your industry.
- Leverage professional networks or events to establish new media connections.

## Follow-Up

- Call contacts after distribution to ensure they’ve received your release.
- Share any updates or new developments during follow-ups.
- Send thank-you notes or emails to journalists who cover your release, building goodwill for future outreach. This is very important. 
- Include links to supplementary materials, such as photos or videos, in your follow-up communications.
- Ask journalists if they need additional quotes, clarifications, or details to strengthen their story.
